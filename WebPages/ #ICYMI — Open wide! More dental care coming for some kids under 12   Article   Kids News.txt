More dental care coming for some kids under 12 Story by CBC Kids News • 2022-11-23 11:35 Dental benefit applies to half a million kids in Canada In case you missed it, a new law has passed that will help more Canadian kids get dental care, even though their families can’t afford to pay for it. The first stage of the Canada dental benefit officially became law on Nov. 17. This means the Canadian government will provide $650 per year for children under 12 who need dental care and whose families earn less than $70,000 a year. Families that earn more than that will still get some money from the government to cover dental costs, but not as much. PROFILE — Say cheese!

The new program kicks in later this year and will be in place for the next two years. Some 500,000 kids could benefit from this law, at a cost of close to $1 billion. The law could also expand by the end of 2025 to include children under 18, too. The benefit came from a deal between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberals and the New Democrats, led by Jagmeet Singh. Michael Barrett, the health critic for the Conservatives, was not in favour of the law. He said most Canadian provinces and territories have plans in place to help low-income families pay for the dentist. Barrett also said the government could help with dental costs in other ways, including lowering the cost of living, which is basically the amount of money you need to pay for essential things, such as food and housing.
