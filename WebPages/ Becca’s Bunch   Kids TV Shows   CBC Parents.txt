Becca, a happy bobble-hat wearing bird sees adventure in every situation and as a result often bites off more than she can chew; landing herself and her Bunch — Russell, Sylvia and Pedro — in some sticky situations. But it’s in the midst of these ‘oops’ moments that Becca’s unique ideas, heart, positive-thinking and leadership skills really shine. And that’s when simple kid-relatable challenges take a bold turn towards the best day ever! Thinking on her feet, Becca will urge a generation of kids to never give up, aim high and have big ideas. Because, once they do, like Becca, adventures just seem to happen. Friends, family and everyone in the neighborwood revel in the surprises Becca Bird makes possible. And All’s Good in the Wood by the end of every episode. Share More Becca’s Bunch > No related entries found.
