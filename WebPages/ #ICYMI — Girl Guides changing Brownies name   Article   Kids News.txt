In a news release, the organization said the name change was an “important and necessary step” to making Girl Guides an inclusive space where “every racialized girl in Canada feels like they belong.” “We heard from girls and from former members and current members that the name caused them harm,” said Jill Zelmanovits, CEO of Girl Guides of Canada. What is Girl Guides? Girl Guides is an organization that focuses on developing skills and relationships for young girls. Girl Guides of Canada members sometimes sell cookies door-to-door.

There are different groups for different ages. Brownies is the group for seven- and eight-year-olds.
