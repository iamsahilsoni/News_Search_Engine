Uzoamaka PHOTOS © Chyloh X Aug 17, 2022 Summer days are always special for me. I pull out the grill to experiment on some of the vegan recipes I’ve being creating throughout the winter, the blender comes out of hiding and my healthy warm-weather dishes are ready to please the palate at any time of day. Below you'll find three of my favourite recipes from this summer that keep it simple, satisfying yet nutritious: Broccoli Patties Cabbage Rice Rolls Spinach and Avocado Smoothie Broccoli Patties I may not always be perfect at it, but I try to make healthy meals for my family since I believe that living an abundant life begins with being physically and mentally strong. So for lunch or dinner, I'll turn to my broccoli patties (pictured above) — they're great on the grill and the brain as this veggie is packed with omega-3 fatty acids and amino acid. What You'll Need 4 cups of broccoli florets 2 tbsp liquid smoke 1 cup of spelt flour 1 onion 1 tsp salt How It's Made In a pot with water, add salt then boil broccoli for three minutes. Next, peel and mince your onion. In a bowl, mince broccoli florets with liquid smoke, then add onion. Add flour slowly then combine all the ingredients until mixture is smooth. Spoon batter onto a greased sheet and flatten to form patties. Bake (or grill) for 20 minutes or until golden. Cabbage Rice Rolls ﻿These cabbage rice rolls have saved me from the huger hell-cry so many times because they are so easy to make. What You'll Need 4 large cabbage leaves 4 cups of vegetable broth 2 cups of rice 1 onion 1 tsp dry rosemary 1 tsp salt 1 tsp pink Himalayan salt 2 tomatoes 2 tbsp olive oil 1 bunch of parsley 1 cucumber lime juice ½ cup of tahini How It's Made In a pot with vegetable broth, add salt, rosemary and rice. Wash cabbage leaves and place in strainer or steamer to steam at the top of pot. Cook both for around 15 minutes. Drain cabbage and air dry on a plate. Dice tomatoes, mince onion, chop cucumber in small squares and remove parsley from stem and mince — place all the ingredients in a bowl with lime juice and pink Himalayan salt. Add rice and mix together. On a wooden cutter, place cabbage leaf and add four spoons of rice then wrap slowly. Repeat the process until rolls are done, serve with tahini. Spinach And Avocado Smoothie This is my go-to smoothie to start the day — I like to call it my Morning Moody Mix. What You'll Need 2 cups coconut milk 2 cups chilled coconut water 3 cups spinach 1 cup oats 1 medium avocado 1 handful of mint juice from a lemon 1 knob of ginger 2 tbsp protein powder How It's Made Peel avocado and slice. Remove mint leaves from stem and wash. Cut one lemon and squeeze juice into blender. Wash, peel and dice ginger. Pour coconut milk, coconut water and other ingredients into the blender and blend for two to three minutes. Serve chilled. (I also use this recipe as a frozen treat!) Maybe in another life I’ll have pizza and pop all summer long, but for now I enjoy preparing meals that I hope will heal, transform and inspire my family to live a healthy life.
