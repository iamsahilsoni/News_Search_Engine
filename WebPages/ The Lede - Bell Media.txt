Aspiring racers have from now until Jan. 6, 2023, to apply for the adventure of a lifetime. For a close look at what it takes to compete, THE AMAZING RACE CANADA, which is hosted by Olympic gold medallist Jon Montgomery, is available for streaming on CTV.ca, the CTV app, and Crave. Based on journalist Lizzy Goodman’s 2017 oral-history book charting the rise and fall of the New York indie-music scene in the early 2000s, the documentary MEET ME IN THE BATHROOM debuts today, only on Crave. With artists such as The Strokes, LCD Soundsystem, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and Interpol leading the way, the doc features many of the movement’s main voices, as well as plenty of archival footage. Vogue describes MEET ME IN THE BATHROOM as “more than just a nostalgia trip, examining the impact of the scene within the almost-unrecognizable music industry of today.” Subscribe now Don’t miss the daily look at key Bell Media programming information mixed with current entertainment news.
