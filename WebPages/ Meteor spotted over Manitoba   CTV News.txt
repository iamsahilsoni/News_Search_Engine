A meteor was caught streaking across the sky in the province, with cameras catching it in Winnipeg and other areas north of the city. “This is basically the larger cousin of the typically falling star, shooting star, or meteor, whatever you want to call it that we see sort of all the time, but this is a bigger version of it,” said Scott Young, planetarium astronomer with the Manitoba Museum. “They're pretty rare for an individual to see; we don't spend a lot of time looking at the sky.” Videos of the meteor, which Young said is “one to remember,” show it giving off a bright green fireball as it burns.

Partly because the things that are in meteorites, iron and nickel and other trace elements like that copper, give off green, but also because our eyes are most sensitive to green light, when we're using our night vision, and that's what most people would have had is their night time vision.” In addition to Winnipeg, the meteor was also spotted in North Dakota, northwestern Ontario and in Manitoba’s Interlake region, Young said. He adds people in those areas should check their doorbell or dashboard cameras to see if they have spotted something. Reports can be filed on the American Meteor Society's website.
